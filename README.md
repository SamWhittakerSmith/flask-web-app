# Flask Web App

## About

A basic web app to create notes. It covers user account creation, database storage, user authentication, and association between a user and their information.

The UI was built using Bootstrap, while the back-end was built with Python and the Flask web framework. 

I followed a YouTube tutorial to create this.
